Arrays and Strings----------------
1)Find the duplicate number in an array of integers.
2)Reverse a string in-place.
3)Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
4)Find the first non-repeating character in a string.


Linked Lists---------------------
1)Reverse a linked list.
2)Detect a cycle in a linked list.
3)Find the middle element of a linked list in one pass.


Trees and Graphs------------------------
1)Implement a binary search tree (BST) and write functions for insert, delete, and search.
2)Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
3)Perform a depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph.


Sorting and Searching--------------------------------
1)Implement quicksort and analyze its time complexity.
2)Find the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
3)Given a sorted array, find if there exists a pair of elements that sum to a given target.


Dynamic Programming--------------------------------------
1)Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.
2)Find the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings.
3)Compute the minimum edit distance between two strings.


Miscellaneous-------------------------------------------
1)Implement a stack using queues and vice versa.
2)Design and implement a least recently used (LRU) cache.
3)Explain the difference between depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), and when each is appropriate to use.


System Design with Data Structures-----------------------------------------
1)Design a URL shortening service (like bit.ly).
2)Design a system to manage large sets of geographical coordinates and efficiently find nearby points.

Advanced Topics----------------------------------------------
1)Discuss different types of hash functions and their applications.
2)Explain the concept of Big-O notation and how it relates to the performance of algorithms.
3)Describe how you would implement a concurrent data structure or algorithm in a multi-threaded environment.
