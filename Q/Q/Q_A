Advanced Coding Challenges: You might be given more complex coding problems related to data structures, algorithms, or specific scenarios involving Node.js and React.js. They may test your ability to write efficient and clean code using TypeScript.

System Design: Expect questions or exercises where you need to design the architecture of a web application or a specific component using Node.js and React.js. This could involve discussing how you would structure a RESTful API, handle authentication/authorization, manage state in React, etc.

Frameworks and Libraries: You may be asked detailed questions about the frameworks and libraries you've listed (Node.js, React.js, TypeScript). Be prepared to explain how you have used these technologies in previous projects, any challenges you faced, and how you resolved them.

Database and SQL Queries: Since MySQL is mentioned, be ready for questions on database design principles, SQL queries (especially complex joins, aggregations, optimizations), and how you would integrate MySQL with Node.js for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

Debugging and Problem-Solving: Practical scenarios or debugging tasks where you might be given a piece of code (Node.js backend or React frontend) with issues, and you need to identify and fix the problems.

Web Development Best Practices: Questions on security best practices, performance optimization techniques for Node.js and React.js applications, scalability considerations, etc.

Behavioral and Team Fit Questions: They might delve into how you work in a team, handle challenges, and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

Coding Standards and Practices: Expect questions around your familiarity with coding standards, version control systems (like Git), code reviews, and continuous integration/delivery practices.
